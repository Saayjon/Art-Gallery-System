            <h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
            <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 - 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology.</p>

          <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
          <p>The Mona Lisa, a half-length portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506, is one of the most famous and iconic paintings in the world. It portrays a woman, believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy merchant, who commissioned the portrait.
            The painting's most striking feature is Mona Lisa's enigmatic expressionâ€”her subtle smile and mysterious gaze, which seem to change depending on the viewer's perspective. This has contributed to much speculation and intrigue over the centuries.
